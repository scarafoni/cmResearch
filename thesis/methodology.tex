Our project began by creating a small webapp which coordinated the instruction generating process.
This program, also dubbed ``Canned Mentorship,'' consisted of two separate programs:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item a website interface for coordinating working users
	\item a back-end AI script for classifying answers and removing redundant inputs
\end{enumerate}
