This project provides much needed data on the efficacy of machine learning algorithms to sort and cluster crowd input.
Our findings indicate that the most effective algorithm for doing so is the diverse algorithm coupled with hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
This finding is consistend with findings in previous studies \cite{achananuparp2008evaluation}.
The project also shows a great disparity between feature extraction and distance finding within clustering algorithms.
For example, the diverse algorithm performed much, much worse dependng on which clustering algorithm was used. 
The same is also true for the conceptnet algorithm.
What factors cause this is not presently known, and further research is needed to try and identify underlying causes.

Further, the runtime analysis of this project was inconclusive.
The runtime results did not correlate with the theoretical runtime of most algorithms, which indicates that the testing data was not of sufficiently large to test this feature.
That being said, the custom algorithm does place much additional tax on the runtime of the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm; this indicates that this particular combination can be scaled up to big data sized problems.
However, further testing is necessary to verify this the theory.
